UMRA Landing Page
This is a responsive landing page for UMRA, a health monitoring platform by PonceHealth, designed and built with React and Bootstrap. The project showcases key features, benefits, testimonials, and a call to action to join a waitlist for early access.

Project Structure
The project is built with a component-based architecture, with each section of the landing page implemented as a separate React component. This makes the code modular, readable, and easy to maintain.

src/App.js: The main application file that assembles all the individual components to form the complete landing page.

src/components/: This directory contains all the reusable React components for each section of the page, such as:

Header.js: The navigation bar with the logo, links, and call-to-action buttons.

HeroSection.js: The main hero section with a headline, description, and an early access button.

Features.js: Highlights the core features of the platform.

Benefits.js: Details the benefits of using UMRA.

Testimonials.js: A section for user and professional reviews.

FAQ.js: An interactive FAQ section using a Bootstrap Accordion.

CTA.js: A final call-to-action section with a form to join the waitlist.

Footer.js: The footer with company information, links, and legal disclaimers.

src/assets/: This directory is for static assets like images, logos, and icons.

src/index.js: The entry point for the React application.

src/App.css: A custom CSS file for any styling not covered by Bootstrap.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Bootstrap 5: A powerful, responsive front-end framework for modern web development.

React-Bootstrap: A library that re-implements Bootstrap components as React components.

Bootstrap Icons: An SVG icon library for a clean and professional look.
